# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you wish to contribute to the Aero Toolbox CLI, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the project and clone your fork.
2. Create a local feature branch following the guidelines of [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) naming

```bash
$ git checkout -b <branch>
```

3. Make one or more atomic commits. Each commit should have a descriptive
   commit message, wrapped at 72 characters.
4. Run `npm install` to install needed local dependencies.
5. Run `npm test` and address any errors. Preferably, fix commits in place
   using `git rebase` or `git commit --amend` to make the changes easier to
   review and to keep the history tidy.
6. Push to your fork:

```bash
$ git push origin <branch>
```

7.  Open a pull request.

Aero Toolbox CLI is a tool in constant development. If you have questions, suggestions or problems, feel free to report a problem or contact us.
